  "Codes representing tests for tumor markers. This value set of LOINC codes is not comprehensive and can be extended. Other vocabularies can be used only if the test of interest is not covered by LOINC. Tumor marker tests differ from genetic tests in that they measure levels of protein or other substances produced downstream from RNA protein synthesis.",
